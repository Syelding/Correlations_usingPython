# **Correlation of Movies and their Earnings**

When analyzing metrics of data, it is important to determine which metrics have a close relationship amongst each others. Hence, correlation analysis is used to discover if there is a relationship between two variables/datasets, and how strong that relationship may be. If there is a strong correlation between two variables where one of them is behaving in a partciular way, then you can most likely conclude that the other one will behave similarily. Finding a relationship between variables can uncover patterns that were orignally were unexplainable. A high correlation suggests a strong relationship amongts two metrics while a low correlation shows that they are weakly related.

**Why is Correlation Important?**
You can uncover meaningful insights and find new interdependencies which can reduce cost and filter irrelevant anomalies. However, it is important to note that correlation does not equal causation. Just because a relationship exists does not mean that no further research is needed.
